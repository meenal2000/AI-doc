    "# Tensorflow GPU Problem:\n",
    "\n",

    "This Juputer Notebook works on the same problem, more importantly how to solve the problem.\n",

    "### Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Jupyter Notebook not detecting GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPU exists, but is not detected by the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.test.is_gpu_available()\n",
    " tf.test.is_built_with_cuda()`\n",
    " \n",
    "☝ Run this code in your cell if it results in `False` you can continue to go ahead, but if it results in `True` you need to  look into your problem more closely.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Recongnizing the devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\n",
    " print(device_lib.list_local_devices())`\n",
    " \n",
    "☝ This code will give only stats about CPU if you are into the same problem as that of this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow which you have installed might be built only on CPU so you need to install the GPU based TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try any one of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Run this code into your terminal (Anaconda Prompt) (Active environment) (Recommended):**  \n",
    ">`conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using Pip install TensorFlow 2.0:**\n",
    ">`pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the installation get finished. (This may take time as per your CPU and internet speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### After Installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation is finished try running these codes, and they should probably give the same output as shown but may be with different stats."
